- apiview is shortcut for declaring route for common CRUD function
- GenericAPIView combine shortcut of apiview and automate common CRUD function with declaring CRUD function
- ConcreteApiView combine GenericAPIView and automate common CRUD function without declaring CRUD function
- ModelViewSets is like combination with concreteapiview and the name of the function is readable, ex: use list() instead get()
- use kwargs for url param

differences between APIView and ViewSets
- APIView (not on generic.APIView) :
    1. use get, post, delete, put
    2. automate allowed http method based on what we define in class, ex, define get will allow get method to access

- ViewSets :
    1. use list, create, update, delete, retrieve
    2.
